<p>In this analysis we’ll analyze the rate at which new signups subscribe to paying plans on Buffer. We will also examine how long it takes for new users to subscribe.</p>
<div id="day-subscription-rate" class="section level2">
<h2>28-Day Subscription Rate</h2>
<p>First we’ll look at subscription rates. For each weekly cohort of new users, we’ll calculate the proportion that paid for a subscription <em>within 28 days of signing up</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load data
customers &lt;- readRDS(&quot;subscription_rates.rds&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(converted = subs &gt;= 1)</code></pre>
<p>The plot below shows the proportion of weekly new users that susbcribed to a paid plan within 28 days of signing up. We can clearly see that the subscription rate increased significantly when New Buffer was launched in August of 2021.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The average 28-day subscription rate of users that signed up in the weeks prior to August 2, 2021 was <strong>2.01%</strong>.</p>
<p>For users that signed up on or after August 9, 2021, the 28-day subscription rate was <strong>2.34%</strong>.</p>
<p>This represents a relative increase of around 16%.</p>

<h2>Causal Impact Analysis</h2>
<p>We can use a technique called Causal Impact to estimate the effect that launching New Buffer had on subscription rates.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># get min and max dates
min_date &lt;- &quot;2019-12-30&quot;
max_date &lt;- &quot;2021-12-13&quot;

# create time series object
rate_ts &lt;- zoo(by_week$percent, by_week$signup_week)

# specify the pre and post periods
pre.period &lt;- as.Date(c(min_date, &quot;2021-08-01&quot;))
post.period &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2021-08-16&quot;, max_date))

# run analysis
impact &lt;- CausalImpact(rate_ts, pre.period, post.period, 
                       model.args = list(niter = 5000))

# plot impact
plot(impact, c(&quot;original&quot;, &quot;pointwise&quot;)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Week&quot;,
       title = &quot;Impact on 28-Day Conversion Rate&quot;, 
       subtitle = &quot;New Buffer Launch on August 2&quot;)  +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  theme_light(base_family = &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), face = &quot;bold&quot;),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = rel(1.1)),
        plot.caption = element_text(color = &quot;#777777&quot;, vjust = 0),
        axis.title = element_text(size = rel(.9), hjust = 0.95, face = &quot;italic&quot;),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = rel(.1), color = &quot;#000000&quot;),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = rel(.05), color = &quot;#000000&quot;),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = &#39;#F5F5F5&#39;, color = &#39;#F5F5F5&#39;),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = &#39;#F5F5F5&#39;, color = &#39;#F5F5F5&#39;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The plot above and summary below tell us that the subscription rate was approximately 2.4% after New Buffer launched. In the absence of that launch event, we would have expected the subscription rate to be around 2.0%. In relative terms, we’re looking at an increase of around 16-18%.</p>
<p>The positive effect we’ve observed so far is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random fluctuation.</p>
