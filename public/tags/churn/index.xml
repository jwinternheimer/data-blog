      <description>In this analysis we will analyze the subscription churn rates of New Buffer subscriptions. We&amp;rsquo;ll use a well known technique called survival analysis that&amp;rsquo;s useful when dealing with censored data.
Censoring occurs when we have some information about the time it takes for the key event to occur, but we do not know the survival time exactly. In our case, it occurs when subscriptions have not yet canceled &amp;ndash; we know that the time to churn is at least X days.</description>
